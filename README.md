# Convolution-Neural-Network-with-Image-filter-and-Average-Pooling-and-SupportVectorMachine-Algorithm
I created a Convolution Neural Network with Image filtering using Average pooling and then applied Support Vector Machine Algorithm over it. 
You will require the following things:

import numpy as np
from sklearn import svm
import cv2
from sklearn.neural_network import MLPClassifier as mp

Provide 2-2 images each for 2 categories so total 4 images for 2 different categories.
